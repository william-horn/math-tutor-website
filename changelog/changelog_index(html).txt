@changelog-record:#change[1.0]
    [1.0]-"removed header-text-container"
        *   removed <div class="header-text-container">. this was originally here to solve positioning issues, but has since
            been replaced with h1{font-size: 2.25vw} to base the header's size on the viewport's view width.

@changelog-record:#change[2.0]
    [2.0]-"moved nav bar"
        *   location of nav bar was moved out of <body> into <header> in order to properly align vertically with the rest of 
            the header as the <h1> font-size changes accordingly to the screen width.
